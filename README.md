# JHU-CSSE-COVID-19-time-series-wrangling-and-summaries-in-R
In this project, we practice data wrangling, reshaping, and summary table creation using real-world COVID-19 datasets. We will work through three questions, each with sub-parts that build on each other. Our tasks will make use of the R packages dplyr , tidyr , and gtsummary , along with basic visualization in ggplot2 .
